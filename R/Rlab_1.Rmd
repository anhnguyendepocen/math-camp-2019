## Why Do You Need to Learn R?

- Why do you need to learn programming?

    - Because it makes your life easier!
    - It is helpful in all the steps in data analysis.

\smallskip

- Why R?

    - Free
    - Relatively easy to learn compared to other languages
    - Many people are using it $\rightarrow$ there are lots of helpful resources out there!
    - It's the standard software for quantitative political science (and other social science) research.

## Basic Steps of Data Analysis

1. Specify research question

\smallskip

2. Collect data

\smallskip

3. Preprocess data

    - The data you have can contain errors, be incomplete etc.
    - Clean and tidy the dataset so that it can be used for analysis

\smallskip

4. Summarizing/Visualizing data

\smallskip

5. Statistical analysis

\smallskip

6. Summarizing/Visualizing the results

## R is Helpful...

- For collecting data 

    - Web scraping
    - Text extraction
    - ...
    - By automating the process, we can reduce the costs and errors in data collection.
    
\smallskip

- For data preprocessing

\smallskip

- For data visualization

\smallskip

- For statistical analysis

## Example: Effort and Team Performance in Japanese Professional Soccer

- Do total distance run matter for soccer team performance? 

    - Russia in 2018 World Cup?

\smallskip

- Data collection, preprocessing, \& visualization with R

    - `rcode_jleague.R`


## What You Need to Have

- R

    - Download from CRAN website f
    - https://cran.r-project.org/

\bigskip

- RStudio

    - An interface to use R
    - Optional but very helpful
    - Download from https://www.rstudio.com/

## RStudio

## Tips for Learning/Programming R

1. **Keep Record**

    - Don't directly type your R codes into the console.
    - Store your R codes as .R files.

\smallskip

2. **Make the Code Easy to Understand**

    - Add comments to your code
        - R ignores everything written after `#` in implementing the codes
    - Follow coding guidelines
        - e.g., [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)
        - https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml
    
\smallskip

3. **Practice Makes Perfect!**

## Glossary

- **Object**

    - Named "box"/"container" that we store values/data etc. in R

\smallskip

- **Assignment**

    - The process of creating/modifying objects
    
\smallskip

- **Command/Function**

    - We use a command/function to perform some tasks on an object/objects
    
\smallskip

- **Argument**

    - The definitions, directions, or objects that are passed to a command/function
    
\smallskip

- **Package**

    - A collection of functions, data, and documentations which is publicly shared to enhance the functionality of R.

## Homework & Tomorrow

- Homework

    - Download R and RStudio to your laptop if you haven't done so.
    
\smallskip

- Tomorrow

    - Working with objects and functions
    - Please bring your laptop to the class!
