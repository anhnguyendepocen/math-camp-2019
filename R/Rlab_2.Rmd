## Today

- Using R as Calculator

\smallskip

- Object

    - Object class/type

\smallskip

- Functions

## Using R as Calculator

```{r, echo = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
5 + 3 # summation
4 - 7 # substration
5 * 6 # product
7 / 3 # division
```

## Using R as Calculator (cont.)

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
7 %% 3 # modular (residual)
2 ^ 6 # power
(2 + 5) * 4 + 2 ^ 3 # note the order of calculation
```

## Object

- In R, we store information as an **object**. Once we create an object, we can refer it to its name.

\smallskip

- We assign values to an object using the assignment operator `<-`.

    - We can also use `=` for assignment (although not recommended)
    
\smallskip

- Object class/type

    - what kind of information is stored in the object and how it is stored
    - `typeof()` or `class()` command to see the object type
    
## Object Class/Type

- Data types

    - **Character**: character strings
    - **Numeric**: numbers
    - **Logical**: boolean data (`TRUE`/`FALSE`)
    - *Factor*

\smallskip

- Data structures

    - **Vector**: a single-dimension sequence of data of the same type
    - **Matrix**: a two-dimension sequence of data of the same type
    - **Data Frame**: a two-dimension structure of data of varying data types
    - *List*

## Object: Example

```{r, echo = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
# Numeric vector
num <- c(4, 2, 6, 8, 5) 
# Character vector
program.lang <- c("R", "Python", "C", "Java")
# Logical vector
comparison <- (num >= 5)
comparison
```

## Object: Example (cont.)

```{r, echo = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
# Object class/type
class(num)
class(program.lang)
class(comparison)
```

## Logical Operators

Operator | Meaning
--- | ---
`>` | greater than
`<` | less than
`>=` | greater than or equal to
`<=` | less than or equal to
`==` | equal to
`!=` | not equal to
`|` | or
`&` | and
`is.na()` | `TRUE` if missing
`!is.na()` | `FALSE` if missing

## Logical Operators: Example

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
7 < 5
(6 > 4) | (8 < 5)
(7 > 3) & (9 <= 11)
```

## Command/Function

- We use a command/function to perform some tasks on an object/objects

\smallskip

- Argument: the definitions, directions, or objects that are passed to a command/function

\smallskip

- If we specify multiple arguments, 

    - separate the arguments by commas
    - it is desirable to specify them along with their names unless they are obvious
        - The code looks like `funcname(arg1 = input1, arg2 = input2)`

\smallskip

- We can access to function help files either by `?funcname` or `help("funcname")`

    - However, it is often difficult to understand what the help files are saying..
    - Google search, ask others (including me!)...

## Command/Function: Example

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
log(num)
sqrt(num)
length(num)
sum(num)
```

## Command/Function: Example (cont.)

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
sort(num)
sort(num, decreasing = FALSE)
```


## Command/Function: Example (cont.)

- Output of `help("sort")`

## Tomorrow 

- Working with vectors and matrices with R
